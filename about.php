		<b>The Ken Young Company</b> was established in 1978. We were initially working in residential remodeling
		and insurance related restoration. We moved from there to new construction for a while and then
		shifted our focus to commercial tenant finish construction. About fifteen years ago, we decided to
		get back into residential new construction as the primary focus of our business. We have constructed
		new homes in several areas of Saline and Pulaski counties. At the present time we are focusing on the
		Saline County area. Our goal at the Ken Young Company is to provide quality, affordable housing for the
		residents of Saline County. Many of the standard features in our homes are often considered upgrades by
		other builders. We can build from our plans	or yours. If we can assist you in making your Dream a reality,
		Please give us a call.

				<h2>Ken Young</h2> is the President of Ken Young Company. He has constructed both speculative and
				custom homes in many areas of Pulaski and Saline County. He brings over 30 years of construction
				experience in all aspects of building to the team at Ken Young Company. He obtained his Real Estate
				License in 2000 and his Brokers License in 2002 to aid in the sale and marketing of our homes. While
				he had many years of experience selling houses as the seller, he felt the need to become a Realtor to
				better assist his customers, and to bridge the gap between Builders and Realtors.
